### Hi there, I'm Haitam ðŸ‘‹

A full-stack developer who enjoys building applications with a mix of creativity and code. In my free time, I like working on games and playing around with 3D modeling in Blender. Apart from coding, I also love to travel and hit the gym.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing a video platform using Go and occasionally working on Scooter Brothers, a project built in Unreal Engine.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haitamattar/haitamattar/042f6595d8e4cfb766f66715ba1a9204f4309b38/goLogo.svg" height="30"/>
