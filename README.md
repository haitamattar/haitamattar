### Hi there, I'm Haitam ðŸ‘‹

A full-stack developer who enjoys building applications with a mix of creativity and code. In my free time, I like working on games and playing around with 3D modeling in Blender. Apart from coding, I also love to travel and hit the gym.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go
